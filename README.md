                PHP-LOGIN
------------------------------------------

This is a simple website composed of three pages:
- register.php
- login.php
- home.php

This was a simple exercise to practice managing a user session across different pages.
The form of credential storage used in these files is not valied since I used the $_SESSION superglobal.

To access these pages:
1. Clone this repo:
   -> git clone https://github.com/mgalen007/PHP-Login
2. Start a local web server, like XAMPP (Apache), or use an online PHP editor.
3. Navigate to /login.php or /register.php. (/home.php redirects to /login.php).
